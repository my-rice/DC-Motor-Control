## ðŸš€ Highlights

* Dual control layers: highâ€‘performance position/velocity LQR + dedicated torque (current) loop.
* Observer + antiâ€‘windup + discrete implementation for embedded realâ€‘time execution (84 MHz Cortexâ€‘M4).
* Full Vâ€‘Model engineering workflow (modeling, MIL / SIL / PIL / HIL traces) â€“ see `report.pdf`.
* MATLAB / Simulink models mirrored by handâ€‘crafted C firmware (no autoâ€‘code generation dependency for core logic).
* Data acquisition & rapid tuning scripts (UART â†’ MATLAB live plotting).
* Modular encoder interface (quadrature Hall, 8400 counts / rev at output shaft with gearbox).

## 1. Motivation & Goals
Design and validate a robust, highâ€‘fidelity control stack for a geared DC motor able to: (a) track position/velocity references with minimal overshoot and (b) deliver commanded torque (via current shaping) under load disturbances.

## 2. System Overview (Simulink Models)
The architectural block diagram is defined directly in the provided Simulink models. Refer to these files for the authoritative structure of the cascaded loops, observer integration, and PIL/SIL flow:

Position / Outer Loop Models:
* `position/MIL_pos_pade_observer_discrete_antiwindup.slx` â€“ Full MIL validation (observer + antiâ€‘windup + discrete implementation).
* `position/SIL_PIL_pos.slx` / `position/SIL_PIL_extern_pos.slx` â€“ Software / Processorâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘Loop integration with embedded code.

Torque / Inner Loop Models:
* `torque/MIL_Torque_controller.slx` â€“ Torque (current) control design & tuning.
* `torque/SIL_PIL_torque.slx` / `torque/SIL_PIL_torque_extern.slx` â€“ SIL / PIL validation of torque layer.
* `torque/motor_model.slx` â€“ Electrical + mechanical plant (R, L, J, friction, gear reduction).

Support & Shared Components:
* `quadratureEncoder_module/stm_qeplib.slx` â€“ Encoder (QEP) interface library.
* `Inductance/Tuning_L.slx` â€“ Inductance identification workflow.
* `position/observer.m`, `Inductance/Inductance.m`, `Sensor_calibration/sensor_calibration.m` â€“ Scripted identification / calibration steps feeding model parameters.

| Component | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| STM32F401RE Nucleo | ARM Cortexâ€‘M4 @ 84 MHz, UART, timers, STâ€‘Link |
| Pololu 37D Gearmotor | 12 V brushed DC, 131.25:1 gearbox, 64 CPR internal encoder â†’ 8400 counts/output rev |
| X-NUCLEOâ€‘IHM04A1 | Dual Hâ€‘bridge driver (direction + PWM) |

## 4. Control Design Overview
Core steps (mirrored by scripts / models in repo):
* Parameter Identification: electrical (R, L via `Inductance.m`) & mechanical (gear ratio, friction, inertia) using captured current/voltage/speed datasets.
* State Model: continuous + discretized (zeroâ€‘order hold & Pade for delays where applicable).
* Outer Loop: LQR tuned for weighted compromise between settling time, steady error, and actuation energy.
* Inner Torque Loop: PI / LQR hybrid (depending on configuration) ensuring current â†’ torque linearization.
* Observer: reconstructs unmeasured states (e.g. motor shaft speed) & compensates gearbox dynamics.
* Antiâ€‘Windup: conditional integral clamping on saturation (implemented in discrete form for MCU tick).
* Validation Stages: MIL (pure Simulink) â†’ SIL / PIL (`SIL_PIL_*` models) â†’ onâ€‘board tests logged over UART.

## 6. Quick Start
Prerequisites:
* STM32CubeIDE
* MATLAB / Simulink (Control System; versions 2020b+ tested)
* USB cable for Nucleo; lab power supply (â‰¤ 12 V)

Clone:
```
git clone https://github.com/my-rice/DC-Motor-Control.git
cd DC-Motor-Control
```

Open the desired Simulink model (e.g. `position/MIL_pos_pade_observer_discrete_antiwindup.slx`) to explore the design.

## 7. Building & Flashing (STM32)

To test the hand-crafted embedded firmware:
1. Import `direct_coding` into STM32CubeIDE (File â†’ Import â†’ Existing Projects).  
2. Configure clock & peripherals (already set in `.ioc` files; regenerate only if changing pins).  
3. Build (Debug or Release).  
4. Flash via STâ€‘Link (Run â†’ Debug).  
5. Open a serial terminal (115200 8N1 by default unless modified) or use the MATLAB script below.

To test the controllers with auto-generated code from Simulink:
1. Open the relevant `SIL_PIL_*.slx` model (e.g. `position/SIL_PIL_extern_pos.slx`).
2. Configure the Embedded Coder settings
3. Generate code and deploy to the Nucleo board via PIL workflow.
4. Open a serial terminal or use the MATLAB script for data logging.
